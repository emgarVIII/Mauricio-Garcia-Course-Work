# Netflix Pathways - Unique Services for Cloud Application

In this collaborative project with two other Netflix mentees, we developed a RESTful API using Spring Boot and Spring MVC. The API implements unique features, providing services for random quotes, word definitions, and Magic 8 Ball predictions.

**My contribution**: I was responsible for the word definition randomizer. This involved designing the API endpoint for this service, integrating it into our existing application, and writing tests to ensure its robustness and reliability.

Other key points about the project:
- We each focused on a specific service.
- We used JSON for API requests and responses.
- We implemented MockMvc for effective testing of all API endpoints, ensuring reliability and correctness of the API.

Here is a video explaining the key components and logic of our REST APIs:
