# Netflix Pathways - Unique Services for Cloud Application

This project is for the Netflix Pathways program. 
We developed a RESTful API that implements unique features. This was done using Spring Boot and Spring MVC with two other Netflix mentees, providing services for random quotes, word definitions, and Magic 8 Ball predictions.
Other key points:
● Used JSON for API requests and responses.
● Implemented MockMvc for effective testing of all API endpoints, ensuring reliability and correctness of the API.

Here is a video explaining the key components and logic of our REST APIs:
